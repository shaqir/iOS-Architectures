# iOS-Architectures
iOS architecture refers to the design principles and patterns used to build iOS applications. It focuses on how to structure code, manage data, and ensure a smooth user experience. These architectural patterns help developers create maintainable, scalable, and testable applications while following best practices specific to iOS development. 

In iOS development, architecture patterns define how you structure your app’s code—especially how you separate concerns like UI, business logic, and data. Below is a list of the most common iOS architecture patterns, along with their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.


**🔷 1. MVC – Model-View-Controller (Apple's default)**

📌 Description:
Model: Manages the app's data and business logic.

View: Displays UI and receives user input.

Controller: Acts as a mediator between Model and View.

✅ Pros:
Officially encouraged by Apple.

Easy to understand and implement.

❌ Cons:
Massive View Controller problem: Controllers tend to get bloated with logic.

✅ Use When:
Building small or simple apps.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔶 2. MVVM – Model-View-ViewModel**

📌 Description:
Model: Same as MVC.

ViewModel: Transforms model data into a format View can display.

View: Observes ViewModel and reflects changes.

✅ Pros:
Good separation of concerns.

Works well with reactive programming (Combine, RxSwift).

❌ Cons:
Steeper learning curve.

Overkill for small apps.

✅ Use When:
Building apps with dynamic or complex UIs.

Using SwiftUI or Combine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔷 3. MVP – Model-View-Presenter**


📌 Description:
Model: Handles data and business logic.

View: Displays data but contains minimal logic.

Presenter: Handles UI logic and communicates between Model and View.

✅ Pros:
Testable and maintainable.

Clear separation between UI and logic.

❌ Cons:
More boilerplate code.

Less support in Apple’s native frameworks.

✅ Use When:
Need strong separation and testability for UI logic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔶 4. VIPER – View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router**


📌 Description:
A more modular and scalable architecture:

View: Displays content.

Interactor: Handles business logic.

Presenter: Formats data for display.

Entity: Plain data models.

Router: Handles navigation.

✅ Pros:
Highly testable and scalable.

Strict separation of concerns.

❌ Cons:
Very complex.

Lots of boilerplate code.

✅ Use When:
Building large-scale enterprise apps with teams.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔷 5. Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob's Architecture)**


📌 Description:
Organizes code into Layers: Entities, Use Cases (Interactors), Interface Adapters, Frameworks & Drivers.

Enforces Dependency Inversion Principle.

✅ Pros:
Highly maintainable, testable, scalable.

Clear rules about data flow.

❌ Cons:
Complex to set up and maintain.

Requires more upfront planning.

✅ Use When:
Building long-term, enterprise-level iOS apps.
