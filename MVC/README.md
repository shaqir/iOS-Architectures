In iOS development, **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a foundational software design pattern used to organize code in a way that... 

- separates concerns, 
- improves maintainability
- facilitates collaboration. 

Here's a breakdown of how MVC is applied in iOS:


**üîß 1. Model**

- What it is: The Model represents the data and business logic of the app.

**Responsibilities:**

- Manages the app‚Äôs data and rules.

- Fetches, stores, and processes data (e.g., from Core Data, APIs, or local storage).

- Notifies the controller when data changes (usually via delegation, notification center, or bindings).

Example:

      struct User {
          let name: String
          let age: Int
      }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üé® 2. View**

- What it is: The View displays the UI elements to the user and handles UI interactions.

**Responsibilities:**

- Shows information from the model in a user-friendly way.

- Sends user actions (like button taps) to the controller.

**Example:**

- Storyboards, XIBs, or programmatically created UIView/UIViewController components.

- Labels, buttons, table views, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üß† 3. Controller**

- What it is: The Controller acts as a mediator between the View and the Model.

**Responsibilities:**

- Receives user input from the View and acts on the Model.

- Updates the View when the Model changes.

- Coordinates data flow and handles navigation logic.

**Example:**

      class UserViewController: UIViewController {
          var user: User?
      
          override func viewDidLoad() {
              super.viewDidLoad()
              user = User(name: "Sakir", age: 35)
              nameLabel.text = user?.name
          }
      }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üìå Common Problem in MVC (Massive View Controller)**

In practice, especially in UIKit, the ViewController often ends up doing too much...

- handling UI logic, 
- networking, and 
- data transformation 

This all ‚Äî leading to ‚ÄúMassive View Controllers‚Äù. 

This is one reason developers sometimes adopt other architectures like MVVM, VIPER, or Clean Architecture.
